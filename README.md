Welcome to group 7 final project regarding ev charging stations in Python

This Python project implements a route optimization system for electric cars, focusing on finding the shortest path to charging stations. Utilizing Dijkstra's algorithm, it evaluates the most efficient routes within a predefined network of nodes and edges, ensuring electric car drivers can find the nearest charging station effectively.

When downloading this program, please make sure to download all of the contents in the ZIP file. In the zip file, the 'lib' directory is required to be within the same directory as the python program to work properly.
Also, the Nodes_and_Edges.csv needs to be in the same directory as the Python files as it contains the nodes and edges for the program. 

'pip install matplotlib' as it's a required library for optimizing the nodes and visualizating the nodes in a graph. 'pip install pyvis' second in case matplotlib is not working properly.
